# Maniac Editor (Generations Edition) - Sonic Mania Scene/Level Editor

Find my latest version [here](https://github.com/CarJem/ManiacEditor/releases/latest), yes, it's still a Beta!

Find the original by **koolkdev** over [there](https://github.com/koolkdev/ManiacEditor/releases/latest), from which this version derives. None of this would be possible without the work done in the original!

Find the fork by **OtherworldBob** over [there](https://github.com/OtherworldBob/ManiacEditor/releases/latest), from which this version also derives from. None of this would be possible without the work done in the fork!

BUILD STATUS NOT OFFERED FOR NOW, Sorry.

This Fork is Experimental, if OtherworldBob does not comeback, this might become the main fork. No Guarentees though.

## Plus Compatibility
With help from [SuperSonic16](https://github.com/thesupersonic16) and [Axanery](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIsXoOHibP8wpjcha3bSbMQ), we've got some support for Plus.
Lots still do here!

## New Features

* In-editor visual entities! You can see spikes, rings and many more things! (Contributed by [supersonic16](https://github.com/thesupersonic16))
* Flip a collection of selected tiles as one cohesive block.
* Paste new tiles and entities next to the mouse cursor, not the top left.
* Edit background layers.
* Spawn brand new entities without needing to find one to copy. (They appear in the top left!)
* Import level objects from one level to another. It works quite well for invisible things, like the WarpDoor and BreakableWall; less well (not really at all) for badniks and the like.
  * Pro tip: Be sensible with this one!
* Import sounds from one level to another.
  * This goes hand-in-hand with importing objects. You'll want to import any applicable sounds too.
* Layer reordering, creation, destruction and resizing (too big and the game will crash!); you can also edit some of the magic values assoicated with the layers too.
  * You'll need to fix-up any BGSwitch entities to account for anything you change though.
* New export function to write each layer of a scene to its own file.
* Data Directory switching. You can now switch parent Data directories without closing the application.
* Extra crashes! Save often, backup well.
* Non-descript Undo/Redo helpers that don't tell you much most of the time.
* A Viewer for each tile's collision properties that's ttyled like the in-game one! (Contributed by [rubberduckycooly](https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly))
